            <p>Tell me about your path to becoming a designer.</p>
            <p>My path to becoming a designer or learning about this field started with my wife. Out of the blue she started talking to me about my drawing skills which I had discontinued while serving in the military. This brought up the conversation about why I should go back to school to enhance my skill in drawing. This led me to transfer from Paul D. Camp Community College where I was currently majoring in Criminal justice. To Tidewater Community College changing my major to graphic design.</p>
            <p>Tell me about your aspirations as a designer.</p>
            <p>As far as my aspirations as a designer,my goal is to learn as much as I can about this craft and tell/show some young people that I did it so can you. Giving back to the community means alot to me.</p>
