            <h3>Interactive Design 1 - Spring 2017</h3>
     <img src="images/KJ_wireframe.jpg"alt="KJwireframe">
            <p>My process for creating my wireframe for my favorite musical artist project, was to know and have a little background and lifestyle information about Al Jarreau. I then drew my wireframe accordingly to include color, font, and images of the artist I chose.</p>

             <p>I tryed to show the content of hierarchy by using a abstract photo as my background folowed by a photo of the artist and several album covers placed as a divison along with the text.</p>
