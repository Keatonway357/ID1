            <img src="images/KJ_wireframe.jpg"alt="KJwireframe">
            <p>My process for creating my wireframe for my favorite musical artist project, was to know and have a little background and lifestyle information about Al Jarreau. With that information I drew my wireframe accordingly to include color, font, and images of the artist I chose.</p>
            <img src="images/KJ_Moodboard%201.jpg"alt="Moodboard1">
            <img src="images/KJ_Moodboard%202.jpg"alt="Moodboard2">
            <p>I attempted to show the content of hierarchy by using an abstract photo as my background in moodboard1 folowed by a photo of the artist and several album covers placed as a divison along with the text. For moodboard2 I used a colorful leaf photo as a full background also folowed by a photo of the artist and text along with several album covers and a musical emblem placed as a divison, to show a single column alignment.</p>
            <p>In my next project I would start with having 2 or 3 wireframe templets and pay more attention to the contrast of my background image and paragraph alignment. I would also check more closely at the readability of my text when placing it on a colored background.</p>

            <p>Trying to translate my wireframe & moodboards into HTML + CSS was a little challenging to me. Just remembering the order of the code and keeping everything in grouped order. I found this to be an easy way to locate the code or image your looking for.</p>
            <p>My takeaways from this project is everything I have done so far. Because this is all new to me, right now at this time I would continue to use what I have and experiment with it more to build on what I have learned.</p>
