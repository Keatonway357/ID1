        <h1>The XX Website Analysis</h1>
        <ol>
            <!---------------------QUESTION 1------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The serif font used gave the headers and paragraphs a nice visual style which was easy to read. Did not understand why a sans serif font was used with the first pull quote and the others had a serif font. Also, why have the mail chimp pull quote come in near the middle of the page and not at the end to get props for the web page. I did like that the paragraphs along with the visuals were placed in linear form.</p>
            <!-----------------QUESTION 2------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palette is black and white with some blue and burnt red. The layout is simple but effective, and has a consistent colour theme that does not distract you from the content. The burnt red color used was nicely used in a couple of the quotes as well as the visual video and group photo collage. The one photo with the blue background should have been consistent with the other photos / visual cue photos using the faded black and white background.</p>
            <!-----------------QUESTION 3------------------->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals gave this page a way of expressing the group as being a close family as well as being childhood friends. While the individual visual video gave you a closer look and hint of each persons personality. The quality of some of the visuals were a little grainy which did give it some flavor.</p>
            <!-----------------QUESTION 4------------------->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals on this page were used as a break between the paragraphs along with the pull quotes. Using the photos and video-photos as the visual cues to keep you focused on the group.</p>
