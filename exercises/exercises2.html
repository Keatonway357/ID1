            <!---------------------QUESTION 1------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The font used as headers were a little gothic style as well as the paragraphs and also has the same color hue. The pull quotes did not flow the way it should have been placed on the site. I did like that the paragraphs along with the visuals were placed in linear form. </p>
            <!-----------------QUESTION 2------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>wine color palette! The colors used are grey hue, with white and black. These specific colors I believe were used as a means to catch the user's eye.</p>
            <!-----------------QUESTION 3------------------->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The role of the visuals seem to mirror each part of the paragraphs, and the visuals are only used to express some or no emotion as well as being playful. The quality of some of the visuals were blured which did give it some flavor.</p>
            <!-----------------QUESTION 4------------------->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>The sections are seperated by some quotes and live/still video. Not sure what the visual cues are.</p>
