            <!---------------------QUESTION 1------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The font used for the heading was a sans serif font, then the writer started using a serif font for the paragraph and pull quotes throughout. This was very well put together for this artist web page.</p>
            <!-----------------QUESTION 2------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palette was black and white with a hint of red to start at the beginning of the page. Then the photographer added colored visual /still photos which brought this page together throughout.</p>
            <!-----------------QUESTION 3------------------->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals gave this page a way to express, explain and show how Janelle Monae can be a down to earth person, grounded, as well as beautiful but serious about her music craft.</p>
            <!-----------------QUESTION 4------------------->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals on this page were used as a break along the  side of the paragraphs as well as with the pull quotes. The sections are separated by the color photos and quotes with video photos as visual cues to keep you focused on the artist.</p>
