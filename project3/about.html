<<<<<<< HEAD
Jazz is a kind of music where musicians value themselves on finding their own style. They use improvisation which is typically an important part in most jazz performances, playing solos which they make up on the spot which requires considerable skill. For example, trumpeter Miles Davis sounds are very different than trumpeter Louis Armstrong (which you can definitely hear in the Music Class of Louis Armstrong). There is a tremendous variety in jazz because most jazz is very rhythmic and carries a profound rhythm which jazz musicians like to play in their own distinct styles. You might listen to a dozen different jazz recordings of the same song, but each will sound different. Jazz can also express many different emotions, from pain to sheer joy. Jazz is about taking a familiar song and making it into something fresh. And about taking a tune that everyone knows making it into something personal. Those are just some of the reasons why jazz is a great art form, and why some people consider it “America’s classical music.”
